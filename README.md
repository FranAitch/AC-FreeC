# Tiny Helpers
A collection of mini scripts I wrote to automate some easy tasks.


## AC-FreeC
It's summer, you've got no AC, but you want to cool down your appartment.
This if an auto reminder for when you should close the window before your room heats up again.


## FreezeBreath
Lets you know when it's cold enough to put your frozen goods outside while you defrost the freezer.


## MonthyMail
For when you have to send out the same email(s) every month to the same people.


## TwitterSnipper
Filter tweets with the (roughly) same wording as previous ones from a twitter list.
Particularly useful when you're following news accounts that tweet out the same items repeatedly during a week.
