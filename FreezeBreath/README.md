# Defrost Me
Little script written for my mum to let us know when it's cold enough outside to defrost the freezer.
Works for gmail addresses, for others it has to be tweaked first.

It uses the OpenWeatherMap api, so you have to register with them to get your personal APP ID.
You also need to customize a few variables in both 'defrostme.py' and 'mailMyself.py', like which email
address you want the reminder to be send to, which location should be checked for temperature, etc.
